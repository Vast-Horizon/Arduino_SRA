The Arduino code is under SRA folder\
The LabVIEW inferface is under LabviewHMI folder. It's not necessary to use the interface though.\
The LabVIEW interface with MQTT protocol is in the other folder, this is the one I used in the demonstration video.


To use the LavView interface to control, the arduino IDE must also running, but the serial monitor should be closed.
